## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

My name's Payton Bice and I'm a software developer from Birmingham, AL.

The majority of my professional experience is in **full-stack web** and **hybrid mobile app** development, but I enjoy working across a variety of languages and technologies, and regularly make time to explore unfamiliar technologies and methods of problem solving that pique my interest. Lately, my day-to-day work mostly involves TypeScript, React, and Node, as well as some PHP via Laravel.

Beyond my technical skills, I take pride in being a collaborative team player and effective communicator. I strive to be a positive and dependable person to work with, and love a good challenge. Outside of software development, I also enjoy casual video games, puzzles, and working on home improvement projects.

If you'd like to contact me, I can be reached by email at hellopayton@gmail.com, and by Discord at tas1000. Cheers!
